This is a vendored version of [aioarango](https://github.com/mirrorrim/aioarango)
containing only the portions of the code necessary for the Collections project.
`aioarango` appears to be abandoned and is currently forcing the use of outdated dependencies.
The code here has been modified to remove parts of the code we don't use, remove deprecated code,
and for compatibility with updated dependencies.

If `aioarango` is updated or another async ArangoDB client becomes available, it'd be wise to
switch.
