# eggNOG tool

## Overview
The eggNOG tool is designed to utilize the collections infrastructure for execution and storage of result data.

This tool is exclusively intended for use with the CDM project.

The Collections parser program ([parse_tool_results.py](../../genome_collection/parse_tool_results.py)) will skip parsing the result files generated by this tool, as the result data is
specifically tailored for the CDM project.
